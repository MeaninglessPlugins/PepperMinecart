#English is not my native language,so you may not understand my words#
An interesting plugin by Pepper~

When you press shift and rbutton:

1. If there is an block on the minecart,the block will be kept in your hand. (except TNT Chest etc.)
2. If there is no block on the minecart,the block which you kept will be placed in the minecart


Interact with custom minecart is supported! (like craftingtable minecart) ï¼š

Specially:

1. you can't sit on custom minecarts!
2. there might some bugs in the plugin.
